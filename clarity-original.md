# Total Compensation Plan

### Compensation Philosophy

The purpose of our Compensation Program is to maintain a progressive compensation profile that is:

* Equitable for all.
* Externally competitive.
* Cost-effective for our customers.

Moreover, our Compensation Program enables us to attract, retain, and motivate COMPANY “heroes” who have the knowledge and skills necessary to provide superior products and services.

Our Program is distinguished as a tool to be used in attaining COMPANY and Program objectives. The following principles and procedures provide the framework for our salary administration practices:

* Employees are treated fairly based upon individual performance and the knowledge, problem-solving skills, and accountability required to perform their job.
* Provide incentives for personal growth by utilizing a positive, motivational approach to compensation.
* Maintain a system of control over salary expenses.
* Assure that salary policies are soundly administered and that job analysis elements (including job content questionnaires, evaluations, and salary ranges) are kept up-to-date to maintain the integrity of the Program and to enhance the accuracy of our direct labor rate estimates.
	 
### Elements of COMPANY’s Compensation Program 

COMPANY’s Compensation Program has four principle components: 

* Job Family Summaries
* Career Stream Leveling Guides
* Band and Market Reference Zone Salary Structures
* Market Reference Zones/Salary Ranges

#### Job Family Summaries

COMPANY job family summaries (JFS) are generalized statements that outline the essential functions of a job. JFS must remain general enough to make objective market survey comparisons, yet contain enough information to differentiate one job (or group of jobs) from others. With each promotion or reclassification, an employee may remain in the same job family or job group or move to a different one. 

#### Career Stream Leveling Guides

Career Stream Leveling Guides provide a summary of the type of work and hierarchy of levels with the career stream. Employees progress through their career stream as they gain experience, education, assume increased duties and responsibilities, and contribute a more significant role. Employees may also move laterally into career opportunities that may be available in differing job families. JFS coupled with the Career Stream Leveling Guides are supplemented with contract-specific job descriptions for the purposes of developing a comprehensive overview of an individual’s job. 

All levels of employees are offered the opportunity to grow personally and professionally while receiving promotional and merit increases commensurate with their development and contributions. The education and years of experience criteria, coupled with the other competency requirements, are provided as a general guideline to assist managers in matching employees to jobs. The standard COMPANY equivalency is set at 1.5 years of related work experience per one year of post-secondary education. These levels are consistent with market data and are not intended to restrict or inhibit an individual’s placement based on years of experience or education alone. Individual contract/client requirements may override COMPANY’s standard equivalency. 

#### Band and Market Reference Zone Salary Structures

Compensation band levels increase in direct proportion to the increase in the scope and responsibilities of the job. Those jobs with the same or similar job market value are combined into comparable market reference zones. 

#### Market Reference Zones/Salary Ranges

Market surveys utilized by COMPANY provide representation of comparable jobs, industry, revenue size, and geographic location and include the following: Mercer; Towers Watson; Western Management; Radford; HR Alliance and the Human Resource Association of the National Capital Area. These surveys contain salary data and employee benefits information located in over 800 geographic regions. Our usage of and participation in these market surveys reinforces our commitment to maintaining competitive salary ranges. COMPANY’s Market Reference Zones (expressed in terms of a minimum, midpoint, and maximum) are compliant with FAR 31.205-6 and DCAA guidance (Contract Audit Manual, 5-1020.3, January 1994). COMPANY considers the entire range assigned to a particular grade to be adequate to attract and compensate fully competent job performers. 

COMPANY generally hires employees at salaries between the minimum and midpoint of the salary range. However, there are times when an employee may be hired at a salary above the midpoint. Examples of circumstances where an employee may be hired above the midpoint include candidates with experience and education beyond the minimum required for the job, positions in a new or specialized field with a limited population of competent employees, or where specific contractual experience requirements are outside the market norms. 

For existing employees, salary ranges provide the flexibility to address the variables described above and to accommodate factors that influence salary review decisions. These factors include length of service, elapsed time since last salary review, and individual performance.
